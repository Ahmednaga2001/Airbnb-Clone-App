This project is to create airbnb clone built with Next.js, using an API to fetch rental listings and map data specifically for London. The project features a dynamic, interactive map using Mapbox-GL to display property locations and includes a responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS. Users can search for available rentals in London, with date filtering powered by React-Date-Range.<br>
